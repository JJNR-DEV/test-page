# Klarna Test Page

This page has been develop following the design of Klarna's main website but it has no direct link to Klarna. It has been develop with the purpose of practicing dvelopment with NextJS and creating an idea for a webpage for Klarna where it explores the main events that led to the success of this unicorn startup.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To explore the code locally, first clone this repository to your local machine and once you have "cd" into it, run the code with the following command: 

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Deploy on Vercel

The page has been deployed on Vercel and can be found on the link https://klarna-template.vercel.app/.

## DatoCMS

Within the historical data, the titles are some facts collected from Wikipedia while the data itself its just Lorem Ipsum. This data is stored in [DatoCMS]. The purpose of this is to explore a real life case in where there is a Content Team in place responsible to create content for the website through a CMS. The choice of DatoCMS was due to being well recommended to work along side a serverless framework, but also because it provided a chance to explore how a headless CMS works and to explore GraphQL to fetch data.
